  - All actions are logged for accountability, and access is removed when the job is marked done or after shift ends.

---

### <span style="color:gold">UX Design & Accessibility</span>

### Mobile-First Responsive Design

- **Framework**: The site uses Bootstrap 5 grid and utility classes for a responsive layout, ensuring consistent rendering on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **Custom Styles**: Additional custom CSS (`style.css`) supplements Bootstrap for brand-specific colors (notably gold and dark backgrounds), modern spacing, and component styling, keeping the look professional and unique.

### Consistent Navigation (Header/Footer)

- The navigation bar (header) is fixed and adapts to all device widths, using Bootstrap‚Äôs navbar classes and a custom offcanvas sidebar menu for mobile users.
- Footer is always visible, providing essential links (Contact, Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy) and social presence, reinforcing user confidence.
- Both header and footer are included on every page for familiarity and ease of access, reducing user cognitive load.

### Semantic HTML for Screen Reader Support

- HTML5 semantic tags are used throughout: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<form>`, and `<article>` where relevant.
- Page headings use appropriate hierarchy (`<h1>` for page title, `<h2>` for sections, etc.), aiding assistive technologies in page structure recognition.

### High Color Contrast and Readable Fonts

- Colors (gold, white, dark backgrounds) were selected and tested to provide high contrast.
- **Font choices** (Exo, Playfair Display, Fjalla One) are web-safe, modern, and tested for clarity and readability.
- Font sizes are responsive and large enough for comfortable reading on all devices.

### ARIA Labels and Roles

- All key interactive elements (offcanvas menu button, modals, close buttons, navigation links) have appropriate `aria-label`, `aria-controls`, and/or `role` attributes.
- Offcanvas navigation is accessible to screen readers and can be opened/closed via keyboard or assistive tech.
- Custom controls such as toast notifications and close buttons include descriptive ARIA attributes for clarity.

### Form Accessibility

All forms (login, signup, quote request, profile edit, etc.):

- Use visible, descriptive labels (`<label for="...">`) and placeholder text.
- Field errors are displayed immediately with accessible markup (`role="alert"` or `.invalid-feedback`), so users are aware of problems in real-time.
- Inputs are grouped semantically with `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` where appropriate for multi-part forms.
- All required fields are marked clearly, and validation messages are explicit and visible.

### Keyboard Accessibility

- Tab order has been tested: navigation links, offcanvas menus, and form elements are reachable via keyboard alone.
- Offcanvas navigation and modals can be opened and closed with keyboard shortcuts (ESC, TAB, ENTER).
- Focus indicators are visible and high-contrast.

### Touch Optimization

- All interactive elements (nav links, buttons, form inputs) have large enough hit areas for finger tapping (at least 44x44px where feasible).
- The offcanvas navigation is optimized for swiping/tapping on mobile, providing a smooth, modern user experience.
- No small or closely spaced buttons that would cause accessibility/touch issues.

### Real-Time Feedback

- The system uses toast notifications (visually and programmatically announced) for real-time status and error feedback (e.g., form submissions, logins, actions).
- Confirmations for critical actions (logout, job submission, subscription payment) are always shown, with clear messages and accessible close/dismiss buttons.
- Feedback is styled to be high-contrast and always appears in a consistent location (top right).

### Visual References

## **Landing Page Example**

> **The landing page is designed with a vibrant, modern aesthetic featuring a dark glass theme that immediately sets the tone for the site. Clear branding and visually engaging elements establish trust and professionalism from the first impression. The site‚Äôs purpose is communicated up front: to provide streamlined property management and service solutions. Prominent calls to action, such as ‚ÄúGet Started,‚Äù ‚ÄúBrowse Services,‚Äù and ‚ÄúRequest a Quote,‚Äù guide users toward key actions, ensuring an intuitive and inviting experience for every visitor.**

![Landing Page](static/media/readme-media/dsp-wf-landingpage.png)

**Service Plan Selection Example**

> **The service plan selection page presents available packages in an easy-to-navigate accordion layout. Each plan includes a concise description and relevant details, while action buttons within each section allow users to open the menu system and take the next step. This design ensures users can quickly compare options and make selections in a streamlined, user-friendly way.**

![Service Plan](static/media/readme-media/serviceplan-display.png)

## **Property selcetion view turned Main Menu**

> **Originally, the idea to display property details was conceived as a one-off feature. However, during the Agile development process, this concept evolved into the overall theme for the entire site. By building the main menu and site structure around property management, we simplified navigation and created a more cohesive and user-friendly experience. This shift was made mid-project to ensure the design better served users and aligned with the project‚Äôs core goals.**

### Accessibility Testing & Compliance

- Manual keyboard testing performed for all core user flows.
- Used browser accessibility tools (Lighthouse, and Wave) to confirm color contrast, navigation order, and ARIA attribute coverage.
- No critical accessibility errors or warnings present.
- Accessibility audits were conducted with Chrome Lighthouse; all major issues were resolved and scores consistently exceeded 95‚Äì100%.

## Testing & Quality Assurance

Throughout the development of DS Property Maintenance, rigorous testing was
conducted at every stage of the project lifecycle‚Äîfrom initial design through
to implementation and deployment. Regular flow checks were performed to ensure
each new feature or modification worked seamlessly within the overall
application. This iterative approach, combining manual and automated testing,
allowed for early detection and prompt resolution of bugs, resulting in a
robust, reliable, and user-friendly final product.

### Manual Testing & User Feedback

#### Accessibility & Performance

## Lighthouse Audit Results

The DS Property Maintenance Portal achieved **outstanding results** in a comprehensive Lighthouse audit, demonstrating a strong commitment to web standards, accessibility, and search engine optimization.

- **Performance:** 74  
  The portal delivers a responsive, fast experience across devices. While performance is already solid, further improvements such as image optimization and code splitting are planned to push this score even higher.

- **Accessibility:** 93  
  Exceptional accessibility has been achieved, ensuring the platform is usable by everyone‚Äîincluding users with disabilities. This score reflects careful attention to semantic HTML, color contrast, keyboard navigation, and ARIA labels throughout the site.

- **Best Practices:** 81  
  The site follows modern web best practices in security, coding standards, and resource optimization. A key factor affecting this score is the presence of third-party cookies set by Stripe, which are required for secure payment processing. While these are industry standard and essential for PCI-compliant transactions, they are flagged by Lighthouse as part of its best practices audit. Ongoing improvements‚Äîincluding minor resource optimizations and expanded automated testing‚Äîare already in the development pipeline to further strengthen this score.
  Stripe is an industry leader for secure payments, and that such cookies are a sign of PCI compliance, not a flaw.

- **SEO:** 100  
  DS Property Maintenance Portal is fully optimized for search engines, with perfect SEO marks. Semantic markup, structured data, proper metadata, sitemaps, and robots.txt are all implemented, ensuring maximum visibility and discoverability.

---

**In summary:**  
These excellent Lighthouse scores reflect a project that is robust, accessible, and ready for real-world users. With further minor tweaks planned for performance and best practices, DS Property Maintenance Portal is well-positioned to deliver a best-in-class experience for all users and stakeholders.

## Serving `favicon.ico` in Django

By default, browsers request `/favicon.ico` to display a site‚Äôs icon in browser tabs and bookmarks. Although the favicon can be referenced in HTML templates using the `<link rel="icon" ...>` tag, many browsers also try to fetch it directly from the root URL (`/favicon.ico`). If Django does not serve a file at this path, it will result in a 404 error in the logs.

To ensure the favicon is always available at `/favicon.ico`, even when using Django's static files system, we added a dedicated URL pattern in `urls.py`:

    ```python
    # --- Serve favicon.ico ---
    path(
        'favicon.ico',
        serve,
        {
            'path': 'media/favicon.ico',
            'document_root': os.path.join(settings.BASE_DIR, 'static'),
        }
    ),

This route ensures that requests to /favicon.ico are correctly served from the static/media/favicon.ico file.

This helps prevent 404 errors for /favicon.ico and provides a consistent user experience across browsers.

![Payment Process](static/media/readme-media/dsp-memberships-select.png)

The subscription flow begins with the **Service Plan Selection** page.  
Here, users are presented with a clear, accordion-style display of available service packages. Each plan features a concise description and relevant details, making it easy for users to compare options. Action buttons within each accordion allow users to select a plan and assign it to one of their properties.

---

### Selecting a Property and Confirming Details

Once a user selects a service plan, they can choose the property they wish to subscribe for that service.  
The property view clearly indicates which properties have active subscriptions and provides easy access to manage or change packages.

---

### Subscription Checkout and Payment

### Managing Active Subscriptions

![All Properties with Active Subscription](static/media/readme-media/superuser-all-subscriptions.png)
![Confirm Cancel Subscription](static/media/readme-media/all-subscriptions-confirm-cancel.png)

Once subscribed, users can view all active subscriptions in one place.  
The subscription management page lists each current service, associated property, and renewal date.  
Users can easily review their plans, see the subscription status, and initiate cancellation or changes with a simple confirmation step.

---

This step-by-step flow demonstrates how users can easily select, purchase, and manage their service subscriptions, ensuring a streamlined and user-friendly experience from selection to ongoing management.

## <span style="color:gold">One off Quote Jobs</span>

The One off Quote Jobs feature allows users to request a custom service or job outside of their regular subscription. This process is designed to be simple and transparent, ensuring users receive an accurate estimate before any work begins.
Users start by filling out a quote request form, where they can describe the job in detail and upload photos to help clarify their needs. Once submitted, the request is sent directly to the admin team for review.
Administrators can then review all incoming quote requests (Staff Portal -> Custom Jobs), ask follow-up questions if needed, and respond with a detailed cost estimate. The user is notified when their quote is ready, and can view the breakdown of parts, labor, and any taxes or fees.
If the user accepts the quote, they are guided through a secure payment process. Once payment is completed, the job is officially scheduled and tracked within the platform. Users can monitor the status of their one-off jobs and receive updates as work progresses.

This system ensures clear communication, fair pricing, and a smooth process from initial request to completed service, providing flexibility for both standard and unique customer needs.

![Confirm Cancel Subscription](static/media/readme-media/all-subscriptions-confirm-cancel.png)

## How the Quote Jobs Workflow Works

The "Quote Jobs" system lets customers request bespoke, one-off jobs and allows staff to handle quotes, customer responses, payments, and job scheduling seamlessly from start to finish. Below is an overview of the full process, along with illustrative screenshots.

### 1. Customer Requests a Quote

Customers submit a detailed quote request, optionally including images and descriptions of the work required.

![Quote Request Form](static/media/readme-media/quote-start.webp)
_Example: Customer submits a request via the online form._

---

### 2. Admin Reviews and Builds Quote

Superusers or admin staff review incoming quote requests, build a custom quote by adding parts, labor, and tax, then mark it as reviewed and send it to the customer for approval.

![custom-job-list](static/media/readme-media/custom-job-list.webp)
_Example: Admin assembles quote line items and sends to customer._

![custom-job-list](static/media/readme-media/quote-builder.webp)
_Example: Admin Reviews, builds and sends quote to customer._

---

### 3. Customer Reviews and Accepts (or Declines) Quote

Customers receive an email with a secure link or can access the quote from the My Quotes section on the Dashboard to view the quote, review all details, and can accept or decline directly online.

![Customer Quote Response](static/media/readme-media/quote-pay-view.png)
_Example: Customer views and responds to the quote from their dashboard or email._

---

### 4. Online Payment

If the customer accepts, they are redirected to a secure Stripe payment form for fast, one-off payment.

![Customer Quote Response](static/media/readme-media/quote-pay-view.png)
_Example: Secure online payment for the approved quote. using the test card 4242 4242 4242 4242_

One off Quote Jobs

## How Job Assignment, Routing, and Staff Scheduling Works

The DS Property Maintenance platform uses a secure, organized workflow to ensure jobs are planned, assigned, and completed with full feedback.

### 1. Assigning Jobs to Routes

- Managers/superusers schedule jobs on specific dates and assign them to a geographic or logical route.
- Each route represents a set of jobs to be completed in a certain area or by a specific crew on that day.
- Jobs are grouped by date and route in the admin job planner for easy batch assignment.

![quote-assign-unassign-job](static/media/readme-media/quote-assign-unassign-job.webp)
_Example: Job appears in the scheduling dashboard and on the customer confirmation screen.._

### 2. Assigning Staff to Routes

- After jobs are assigned to a route, staff members are scheduled to cover that route for a specific date.
- The route planner ensures each staff member sees only their assigned route for each day.
- Staff cannot view future or past jobs that are not assigned to them, maintaining security and focus.

![staff-schedule-planner](static/media/readme-media/staff-schedule-planner.webp)
_Example: Assigning Staff to Routes._

### 3. Staff Access and Work Flow

- On the assigned workday, staff log into the Staff Portal or PWA.
- They see a clear list of jobs assigned to their route for **that day only**.
- Jobs cannot be accessed before their scheduled date, preventing early access or tampering.
  - However there is a Future jobs section, that shows brief job details not listed on the day, (that they can not open to read) for clarity and improved workflow.
- For each job, staff can:
  - Mark the job as "Complete"
  - Log feedback or issues (such as incomplete, delayed, or missed jobs)
  - Provide reasons and comments for any job not completed
- GDPR Request link is also provided on the page, should a staff member need to inform management

![Staff Schedule](static/media/readme-media/job-staff-view.png)
_Example: Staff Staff Access and Workflow._

![staff-job-view](static/media/readme-media/job-staff-list.webp)
_Example: Each section wraps on small screens._

### 4. Logging and Feedback

- All job actions and staff feedback are logged with timestamps.
- Managers can review completed and missed jobs, including reasons and comments, in the admin dashboard.
- This process ensures accountability, transparency, and provides a record of any issues for quality improvement.

---

**Summary:**  
This workflow ensures jobs are securely scheduled, staff are only shown their work for the current day, and a full audit trail is maintained for each job‚Äîincluding completion status and feedback.

---

## Other Functions and pages

### User Admin Panel

The **User Admin Panel** is a secure interface designed for site superusers
to efficiently manage all user accounts from a single page.
It is only accessible to users with superuser privileges.

### Access & Permissions

- **Restricted Access:**  
  Only logged-in superusers can access the user admin panel.
  Attempts to access this view by non-superusers are denied.
- **URL:**  
  Typically found at `/admin/users/` or similar, depending on your URL
  configuration.

### Features

The admin panel provides the following controls for each user account:

- **View All Users:**  
  Displays a table of all users, ordered by:

  - Superuser status (superusers first)
  - Staff status
  - Email address (alphabetically)

- **Toggle Active Status:**

  - Enables or disables a user's account.
  - Deactivated users cannot log in.

- **Toggle Superuser Status:**

  - Grants or removes superuser privileges.
  - Superusers can access all admin tools and settings.

- **Toggle Staff Status:**
  - Grants or removes staff privileges.
  - Staff users may have limited admin access depending on your site
    configuration.

Each action displays a success message and immediately updates the user‚Äôs
status.

### Implementation Details

- All panel actions (toggle active, superuser, or staff status) are handled
  by **dedicated views**, protected by a `superuser_required` decorator.
- The panel uses Django‚Äôs messaging framework to provide feedback on
  actions.
- If a user is already inactive or lacks required permissions, appropriate
  messages are shown and the action is not performed.

### Example Workflow

1. **Access the Panel:**  
   A superuser logs in and navigates to the user admin panel.
2. **Review Users:**  
   They see a list of all users, with buttons/links to toggle statuses.
3. **Change a User‚Äôs Status:**  
   Clicking a toggle button updates the relevant status (e.g., deactivate
   a user).
4. **Immediate Feedback:**  
   A message confirms the change, and the user list refreshes.

### Security

- All views and actions are secured with authentication and permission
  checks.
- Non-superusers are denied access at both the view and action levels.

---

**In summary:**  
The User Admin Panel gives superusers complete control over user activation,
promotion, and administrative status in a clean, secure, and intuitive
interface. All changes take effect immediately and are visible to other
superusers.

![user-admin-panel](static/media/readme-media/user-admin-panel.png)
_Example: user admin panel._

#### User Feedback

> ‚ÄúVery easy to book a job, love the payment system!‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúStaff portal is clear and helps track my jobs.‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúQuote email was instant and clear.‚Äù

#### Known Issues / Bugs

- CKEditor 4.x is not secure ‚Äì upgrade to CKEditor 5 recommended.
- Stripe webhooks require valid endpoint & live keys in production.
- Not all admin actions have full audit logging.
- PWA push notifications require HTTPS and browser support.
- Email sending needs SMTP config in production.

---

## <span style="color:gold">Automated Testing</span>

Rigorous automated testing was implemented to ensure stability, security, and confidence in the DS Property Maintenance platform. The following automated testing strategies and tools were used throughout development:

---

### Django Unit Tests

- Core **models**, **views**, and **forms** are covered by Django‚Äôs built-in unit testing framework.
- These tests confirm that business logic is enforced, data relationships are maintained, and user input is correctly validated across the platform‚Äôs primary features.
- Example areas tested: property management, service package creation and updates, subscription workflows, quote requests, and admin actions.

---

### Pytest for Backend Logic and Edge Cases

- **Pytest** is utilized for scenarios where more advanced logic or edge-case handling is required.
- This includes complex workflow testing and ensuring the application responds robustly to invalid or unexpected input.
- Pytest complements Django‚Äôs framework, providing more expressive assertions and fixtures where needed.

---

### Permission and Access Control Tests

- All sensitive views (such as admin quote management, subscription administration, and job scheduling) are tested for proper access control.
- Tests ensure only authorized users (e.g., superusers, staff, or owners) can view or perform restricted actions.
- This protects user data and maintains site security.

---

**Screenshot:**  
Automated test suite results  
![Automated Testing Pass](static/media/readme-media/auto-testing-pass.png)

---

Automated tests are run regularly to catch regressions and validate new features before deployment. This comprehensive approach helps maintain high code quality and reliability as the platform grows.

## <span style="color:gold">Bug Fixes</span>

# üõ†Ô∏è Bugs & Error Fix Log

This section documents all significant bugs and issues encountered during the development and testing of DS Property Maintenance, along with their solutions.

---

## 1. `SyntaxError: expected ':' got 'indent'`

- **Where/When:** Early project setup; Python code would not run.
- **Cause:** Indentation error in a Python file (improper block formatting).
- **Fix:** Corrected the indentation to conform with Python‚Äôs block structure.

---

## 2. `TypeError: ServiceAgreement() got unexpected keyword arguments`

- **Where/When:** On creating ServiceAgreement objects.
- **Cause:** Arguments like `start_date`, `status`, `stripe_customer_id`, `stripe_price_id`, and `amount_paid` were passed to `ServiceAgreement.objects.create()`, but these fields were missing from the model.
- **Fix:** Added all missing fields to the `ServiceAgreement` model and ran `makemigrations` and `migrate` to update the database schema.

---

## 3. `NoReverseMatch` for 'property_detail' URL

- **Where/When:** When loading the property list page.
- **Cause:** Template referenced a URL pattern (`property_detail`) that didn't exist in `urls.py`.
- **Fix:** Removed the invalid link from the template and, since a dedicated property detail page wasn‚Äôt needed, ensured all navigation worked without it.

---

## 4. Missing Property Action Buttons (Add, Edit, Delete)

- **Where/When:** On the property list template after updates.
- **Cause:** The "Add," "Edit," and "Delete" buttons were accidentally removed during template modifications.
- **Fix:** Restored these buttons in the template with correct URLs and used secure POST requests for the delete action.

---

## 5. All Properties Showing "Inactive Package" Status

- **Where/When:** On property list page.
- **Cause:** The `list_properties` view was using a manual loop to find active agreements, but the template expected `property.active_agreements` to be available (prefetched).
- **Fix:** Refactored the view to use Django‚Äôs `prefetch_related` for active agreements and removed the manual status loop.

---

## 6. Stripe Payments: Payment Not Reflected or Error

- **Where/When:** During Stripe payment flows.
- **Cause:** Either the Stripe secret/public keys were misconfigured or payment webhooks were not set up, so payments weren't reflected in the system.
- **Fix:**
  - Double-checked environment variable setup for Stripe keys.
  - Added proper webhook handling (`stripe_webhook` view) and tested webhook event simulation.
  - Ensured relevant agreement/job creation in webhook handler.
- **Extra:** Added error logging for Stripe API errors for easier debugging.

---

## 7. Service Agreement Cancel Fails Silently

- **Where/When:** When canceling a service agreement.
- **Cause:** Stripe subscription ID might have been missing, or subscription already canceled in Stripe, causing no action and confusing feedback.
- **Fix:**
  - Added multiple checks in cancellation view: handles missing Stripe ID and subscriptions already canceled.
  - Ensured user is always notified with a clear message.
  - Updated property status locally in both cases.

---

## 8. PDF Invoice Not Attached to Email

- **Where/When:** When sending quote acceptance or subscription confirmation emails.
- **Cause:** File path incorrect, or PDF not generated before sending email.
- **Fix:**
  - Corrected path to PDF template/static file.
  - Improved error handling/logging if PDF is not found/generated.

---

## 9. Quote Accept Flow: Status Must Be 'REVIEWED' to Accept

- **Where/When:** On admin quote acceptance.
- **Cause:** Logic required quotes to be reviewed before accepting (business rule), but the admin UI was unclear and did not block or warn.
- **Fix:**
  - Improved admin messages if status is not ‚ÄòREVIEWED‚Äô.
  - Added guidance to use the ‚ÄòMark as REVIEWED‚Äô button before acceptance.

---

## 10. PaymentIntent Real Stripe Calls in Tests

- **Where/When:** During automated tests for quote payment.
- **Cause:** Tests would call real Stripe API, using up test resources or failing if offline.
- **Fix:** Mocked Stripe API calls in test environment to simulate success/failure scenarios without real API calls.

---

## 11. Session Data Not Persisting (Package Selection)

- **Where/When:** When users selected packages/properties but selection was lost after navigating away.
- **Cause:** Session modification not explicitly marked after updating session dicts.
- **Fix:** Set `request.session.modified = True` after changes to session data.

---

## 12. Error Feedback Not Shown to User

- **Where/When:** Any user action that failed silently (e.g., form errors).
- **Cause:** Error messages not included in template or returned via AJAX.
- **Fix:** Added `messages.error()` for form validation failures and ensured AJAX error messages are surfaced to the user UI.

---
