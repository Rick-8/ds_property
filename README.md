---

### <span style="color:gold">UX Design & Accessibility</span>

### Mobile-First Responsive Design

- **Framework**: The site uses Bootstrap 5 grid and utility classes for a responsive layout, ensuring consistent rendering on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
- **Custom Styles**: Additional custom CSS (`style.css`) supplements Bootstrap for brand-specific colors (notably gold and dark backgrounds), modern spacing, and component styling, keeping the look professional and unique.

### Consistent Navigation (Header/Footer)

- The navigation bar (header) is fixed and adapts to all device widths, using Bootstrap‚Äôs navbar classes and a custom offcanvas sidebar menu for mobile users.
- Footer is always visible, providing essential links (Contact, Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy) and social presence, reinforcing user confidence.
- Both header and footer are included on every page for familiarity and ease of access, reducing user cognitive load.

### Semantic HTML for Screen Reader Support

- HTML5 semantic tags are used throughout: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<form>`, and `<article>` where relevant.
- Page headings use appropriate hierarchy (`<h1>` for page title, `<h2>` for sections, etc.), aiding assistive technologies in page structure recognition.

### High Color Contrast and Readable Fonts

- Colors (gold, white, dark backgrounds) were selected and tested to provide high contrast.
- **Font choices** (Exo, Playfair Display, Fjalla One) are web-safe, modern, and tested for clarity and readability.
- Font sizes are responsive and large enough for comfortable reading on all devices.

### ARIA Labels and Roles

- All key interactive elements (offcanvas menu button, modals, close buttons, navigation links) have appropriate `aria-label`, `aria-controls`, and/or `role` attributes.
- Offcanvas navigation is accessible to screen readers and can be opened/closed via keyboard or assistive tech.
- Custom controls such as toast notifications and close buttons include descriptive ARIA attributes for clarity.

### Form Accessibility

All forms (login, signup, quote request, profile edit, etc.):

- Use visible, descriptive labels (`<label for="...">`) and placeholder text.
- Field errors are displayed immediately with accessible markup (`role="alert"` or `.invalid-feedback`), so users are aware of problems in real-time.
- Inputs are grouped semantically with `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` where appropriate for multi-part forms.
- All required fields are marked clearly, and validation messages are explicit and visible.

### Keyboard Accessibility

- Tab order has been tested: navigation links, offcanvas menus, and form elements are reachable via keyboard alone.
- Offcanvas navigation and modals can be opened and closed with keyboard shortcuts (ESC, TAB, ENTER).
- Focus indicators are visible and high-contrast.

### Touch Optimization

- All interactive elements (nav links, buttons, form inputs) have large enough hit areas for finger tapping (at least 44x44px where feasible).
- The offcanvas navigation is optimized for swiping/tapping on mobile, providing a smooth, modern user experience.
- No small or closely spaced buttons that would cause accessibility/touch issues.

### Real-Time Feedback

- The system uses toast notifications (visually and programmatically announced) for real-time status and error feedback (e.g., form submissions, logins, actions).
- Confirmations for critical actions (logout, job submission, subscription payment) are always shown, with clear messages and accessible close/dismiss buttons.
- Feedback is styled to be high-contrast and always appears in a consistent location (top right).

### Visual References

## **Landing Page Example**

> **The landing page is designed with a vibrant, modern aesthetic featuring a dark glass theme that immediately sets the tone for the site. Clear branding and visually engaging elements establish trust and professionalism from the first impression. The site‚Äôs purpose is communicated up front: to provide streamlined property management and service solutions. Prominent calls to action, such as ‚ÄúGet Started,‚Äù ‚ÄúBrowse Services,‚Äù and ‚ÄúRequest a Quote,‚Äù guide users toward key actions, ensuring an intuitive and inviting experience for every visitor.**

![Landing Page](static/media/readme-media/dsp-wf-landingpage.png)

**Service Plan Selection Example**

> **The service plan selection page presents available packages in an easy-to-navigate accordion layout. Each plan includes a concise description and relevant details, while action buttons within each section allow users to open the menu system and take the next step. This design ensures users can quickly compare options and make selections in a streamlined, user-friendly way.**

![Service Plan](static/media/readme-media/serviceplan-display.png)

## **Property selcetion view turned Main Menu**

> **Originally, the idea to display property details was conceived as a one-off feature. However, during the Agile development process, this concept evolved into the overall theme for the entire site. By building the main menu and site structure around property management, we simplified navigation and created a more cohesive and user-friendly experience. This shift was made mid-project to ensure the design better served users and aligned with the project‚Äôs core goals.**

![Menu Idea](static/media/readme-media/dsp-wf-property-turn-package.webp)

---

### Accessibility Testing & Compliance

- Manual keyboard and screen reader testing performed for all core user flows.
- Used browser accessibility tools (Lighthouse, Axe, or Wave) to confirm color contrast, navigation order, and ARIA attribute coverage.
- No critical accessibility errors or warnings present.
- Accessibility audits were conducted with Chrome Lighthouse; all major issues were resolved and scores consistently exceeded 95‚Äì100%.

## Serving `favicon.ico` in Django

By default, browsers request `/favicon.ico` to display a site‚Äôs icon in browser tabs and bookmarks. Although the favicon can be referenced in HTML templates using the `<link rel="icon" ...>` tag, many browsers also try to fetch it directly from the root URL (`/favicon.ico`). If Django does not serve a file at this path, it will result in a 404 error in the logs.

To ensure the favicon is always available at `/favicon.ico`, even when using Django's static files system, we added a dedicated URL pattern in `urls.py`:

```python
# --- Serve favicon.ico ---
path(
    'favicon.ico',
    serve,
    {
        'path': 'media/favicon.ico',
        'document_root': os.path.join(settings.BASE_DIR, 'static'),
    }
),
This route ensures that requests to /favicon.ico are correctly served from the static/media/favicon.ico file.

This helps prevent 404 errors for /favicon.ico and provides a consistent user experience across browsers.



## Subscription: Select, Buy, and Manage

---

### Service Plan Selection


![Payment Process](static/media/readme-media/dsp-memberships-list.png)

![Payment Process](static/media/readme-media/dsp-memberships-select.png)

The subscription flow begins with the **Service Plan Selection** page.  
Here, users are presented with a clear, accordion-style display of available service packages. Each plan features a concise description and relevant details, making it easy for users to compare options. Action buttons within each accordion allow users to select a plan and assign it to one of their properties.

---

### Selecting a Property and Confirming Details


Once a user selects a service plan, they can choose the property they wish to subscribe for that service.  
The property view clearly indicates which properties have active subscriptions and provides easy access to manage or change packages.

---

### Subscription Checkout and Payment

![Payment Terms](static/media/readme-media/dsp-memberships-terms.png)

![Payment Terms](static/media/readme-media/dsp-memberships-terms-pay.png)

![Payment Terms](static/media/readme-media/payment-process.png)

![Payment Terms](static/media/readme-media/dsp-memberships-terms-pay-success.png)


After selecting a plan and property, users are guided through a secure checkout process powered by Stripe.  
A summary of the selected service, pricing, and terms is displayed.  
Users must review and accept the terms before proceeding. The payment process is intuitive, ensuring transparency and security throughout.

---

### Managing Active Subscriptions

![All Properties with Active Subscription](static/media/readme-media/superuser-all-subscriptions.png)
![Confirm Cancel Subscription](static/media/readme-media/all-subscriptions-confirm-cancel.png)

Once subscribed, users can view all active subscriptions in one place.  
The subscription management page lists each current service, associated property, and renewal date.  
Users can easily review their plans, see the subscription status, and initiate cancellation or changes with a simple confirmation step.

---

This step-by-step flow demonstrates how users can easily select, purchase, and manage their service subscriptions, ensuring a streamlined and user-friendly experience from selection to ongoing management.



## One off Quote Jobs

The One off Quote Jobs feature allows users to request a custom service or job outside of their regular subscription. This process is designed to be simple and transparent, ensuring users receive an accurate estimate before any work begins.
Users start by filling out a quote request form, where they can describe the job in detail and upload photos to help clarify their needs. Once submitted, the request is sent directly to the admin team for review.
Administrators can then review all incoming quote requests, ask follow-up questions if needed, and respond with a detailed cost estimate. The user is notified when their quote is ready, and can view the breakdown of parts, labor, and any taxes or fees.
If the user accepts the quote, they are guided through a secure payment process. Once payment is completed, the job is officially scheduled and tracked within the platform. Users can monitor the status of their one-off jobs and receive updates as work progresses.

This system ensures clear communication, fair pricing, and a smooth process from initial request to completed service, providing flexibility for both standard and unique customer needs.
