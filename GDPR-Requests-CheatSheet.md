# GDPR Requests Cheat Sheet

**For all staff, administrators, or anyone handling user data in DS Property Maintenance.**

This guide explains exactly what to do if a user asks for:

- **Access** to their personal data (“What information do you hold about me?”)
- **Correction/Rectification** (“Please update or fix my details.”)
- **Deletion/Erasure** (“Please delete my data/account.”)

---

## Step-by-Step Procedure

1. **Acknowledge the request promptly and politely.**
   - Thank the user and confirm you will process their request as soon as possible.

2. **Record the request details.**
   - Write down: the date/time, user’s name/email, the type of request (access, correction, deletion), and how the request was received (e.g., email, contact form).

3. **Verify the user’s identity if required.**
   - Before releasing or changing any data, make sure you are communicating with the actual account holder (for example, by confirming their registered email or contacting them via their account).

4. **Do NOT provide or alter any data unless you are sure of their identity.**
   - If unsure, escalate to the Data Protection Lead (site owner/admin).

5. **Forward the request to the Data Protection Lead (site owner) if you are not the site owner.**

6. **Ensure a response is provided within 30 days.**
   - All GDPR requests must be resolved or responded to within one month.

7. **Log the request and the outcome in the private admin record or log.**
   - This helps demonstrate compliance if needed.

## Important Reminders

- **NEVER** ignore a GDPR or privacy-related request.
- **NEVER** share personal data with anyone unless you are confident of their identity.
- **If in doubt, always escalate to the Data Protection Lead.**
- Users have the right to access, correct, or request erasure of their data at any time, unless legal/business reasons require its retention (e.g., invoices).

## Where to Get Help

- The Data Protection Lead for DS Property Maintenance is the Duty Manager, or senior management team. If you are unsure how to respond, always ask them first.

**All staff must read and understand this document before handling user data.**
